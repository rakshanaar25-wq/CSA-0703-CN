1) Q1 — Error Detection & Correction: Catch the Corrupted Message

2) What this program does
This Python program simulates sending short text messages over a "noisy" 
communication channel and checks whether the message got corrupted during 
transmission, using two different error-detection methods: **parity bit** 
and **checksum**.

3) How it works
1. Each message (e.g. "HELLO") is converted into binary (8 bits per character).
2. A parity bit is calculated for the original message.
3. A random bit in the message is flipped to simulate noise/corruption 
   during transmission.
4. The corrupted message is checked against the original using:
   - **Parity check** — compares the number of 1-bits before and after.
   - **Checksum check** — compares the sum of character codes before and after.
5. The program prints whether each check detected the error or not.

4) What is parity?
A parity bit is one extra bit added to a message that keeps track of 
whether the total number of 1s in the message is even or odd. If even one 
bit gets flipped during transmission, the count of 1s changes, so the 
parity bit no longer matches — and the receiver knows something went 
wrong. It's simple and fast, but it only reliably catches an **odd** 
number of bit errors — if two bits flip at once, they can cancel out and 
the parity check won't notice.

5) What is a checksum?
A checksum adds up the numeric (ASCII) values of every character in the 
message and sends that total along with the message. The receiver 
recalculates the sum and compares it to the one that was sent. If they 
don't match, the message was altered. Checksums catch a wider range of 
errors than parity because they depend on the actual values of the 
characters, not just a single even/odd count.

6) Results from my test run
I tested 5 messages, each with one random bit flipped:

| Message   | Parity Check    | Checksum Check   |
|-----------|-----------------|-------------------|
| HELLO     | ERROR DETECTED  | ERROR DETECTED    |
| NETWORK   | ERROR DETECTED  | ERROR DETECTED    |
| PYTHON3   | ERROR DETECTED  | ERROR DETECTED    |
| DATA101   | ERROR DETECTED  | ERROR DETECTED    |
| PACKET!   | ERROR DETECTED  | ERROR DETECTED    |

7) Which method worked better?
In this run, both methods caught every single-bit error, because 
flipping even one bit always changes both the parity and the checksum. 
However, parity is known to be weaker in general — it can miss errors 
where an *even* number of bits flip at once (the changes cancel each 
other out), while a checksum is much less likely to miss this since it 
depends on the actual character values, not just a 1s/0s count. So while 
they performed equally here, checksum is the more reliable method overall 
for real-world noisy channels.
